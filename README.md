# Object-Detection-Android

   ## Object detection applications have influenced a large portion of automation in the current era of evolving technology.
 
   ## Image detection and classification in mobile applications have become more prominent over the years and have aided people in a lot of ways, eg. google lens, Camscanner etc.
  
   ## In this paper, we built an object detection application for mobile devices that would aid the visually challenged people by detecting the objects that are situated closest to the user and alerting them about their position and distance of the object from where they are present. Specifically, we try to identify a set of 3 objects (People, Chairs and Cars) in the environment that the smartphone camera detects and identifies, we also estimate the distance of the object from the userâ€™s camera and also infer the position of the object from the center of the screen. 
   
   
   ## Given this information, we can alert the person of the presence of such objects next to them, thus enabling the person to be more aware of their surroundings.
