# Object Detection Android Application

## 📱 Project Overview

Object detection applications have played a significant role in driving automation in the modern era of rapidly evolving technology.  
In recent years, **image detection and classification in mobile applications** have become increasingly prominent, providing valuable assistance in daily life through applications such as **Google Lens** and **CamScanner**.

This project focuses on the development of an **Android-based object detection application** designed to assist **visually impaired users** by improving their awareness of their immediate surroundings.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Visually challenged individuals often face difficulties in identifying nearby objects and understanding their position and distance in real time.  
This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging **computer vision and mobile object detection techniques**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We developed a mobile application capable of:

- Detecting objects using the smartphone camera
- Identifying objects that are **closest to the user**
- Estimating the **distance between the user and detected objects**
- Determining the **relative position of objects** with respect to the center of the screen
- Alerting users through feedback mechanisms to improve situational awareness

The system is specifically trained to detect the following object categories:
- **People**
- **Chairs**
- **Cars**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The smartphone camera captures real-time video frames.
2. An object detection model processes the frames to identify predefined object classes.
3. The system estimates:
   - Object distance from the camera
   - Object position relative to the center of the screen
4. The application notifies the user about the detected objects, enabling safer navigation.
